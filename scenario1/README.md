# ANIMATAS Waves Scenario 1

This is the first scenario in the waves task of the 
[ANIMATAS](http://www.animatas.eu/) project. 
The user is presented with a discrete set of waves as well as a target wave 
which is a composition of waves from the discrete set.
By solving these tasks, a human teaches an artificial agent how to solve similar tasks.
