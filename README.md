# ANIMATAS Waves Scenario 1

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/animatas-waves/badge/?version=latest)](https://animatas-waves.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This is the first scenario in the waves task of the 
[ANIMATAS](http://www.animatas.eu/) project. 
The user is presented with a discrete set of waves as well as a target wave 
which is a composition of waves from the discrete set.
Using this scenario a human can both learn about interference in an interactive
manner and teach an artificial agent how to solve such tasks.
